This bug occurs when using the `useMemo` hook in React Native with a function that returns an object.  If the object's properties are objects or arrays, and those nested objects/arrays are mutated, the `useMemo` hook might not re-render the component as expected, leading to stale data. This happens because `useMemo` performs a shallow comparison; it only checks for changes in the top-level properties of the returned object, not the nested ones.
